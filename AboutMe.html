				<h2>Hobbies</h2>
				<p>From a very young age, I have been playing soccer, and it has been my passion my whole life. Something else that I really enjoy doing is camping because it is very fun and a good relaxation. Something that I really enjoy doing at home with my friends is playing video games. Wake boarding and skiing are also really fun.</p>

				<h2>Summary of My Life</h2>
				<p>I was born on January 4, 2003 to my family of four, at the time.I went to two different pre-schools when i was three and four When I was five, I began playing soccer when I was 5 that began my love for soccer.  Over my third-fourth grade summer, I flew on a plane to Mexico and vacationed in Cabo San Lucas, and we now go there every other summer. When I was eleven, I bridged from Cub Scouts to Boy Scouts, the program that I am in today.  In seventh and eighth grade, I played for my school's soccer team, and in my eighth grade year, we made it to the quarter finals which was a lot of fun. Once I graduated from Holy Name of Mary School,I had been planning on attending Damien High School because my other brothers were already there. This was great because after being at the same school for ten years, it was a nice change. Being surrounded by so many great people, especially my parents, has made my life a whole lot of fun, and I am so happy that I can live my life.</p>
